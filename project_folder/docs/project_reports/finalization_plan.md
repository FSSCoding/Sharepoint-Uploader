[Finalization and Validation] - Project Report
Original Report Date: Not specified in original document
Project Phase: Planning

1. Executive Summary
This plan outlines the final steps to ensure all requirements from the `project_blueprint.md` are met, the application is robust, and it is ready for "production" use. It details the audit, implementation, testing, and documentation phases required for project completion.

2. Key Accomplishments
*   This document outlines a plan for future work; therefore, a list of accomplishments is not applicable. The primary accomplishment is the formulation of this detailed finalization strategy.

3. Challenges and Resolutions
*   This document is a forward-looking plan. Challenges and resolutions will be documented as they are encountered during the execution of this plan.

4. Consolidated Status
The project is in the final planning stage. The defined next steps involve a thorough audit against the project blueprint, implementation of any identified gaps, a comprehensive testing cycle, and a final documentation review before the project can be considered complete.

5. Next Steps (as of original date)
*   **Phase 1: Feature & Success Criteria Audit**
    *   Conduct a thorough audit of the project against the blueprint.
    *   Create a detailed checklist mapping every functional requirement and success criterion to the current project state.
*   **Phase 2: Gap Implementation**
    *   Implement manual retry logic for failed uploads.
    *   Ensure graceful shutdown (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) with state flushing.
    *   Add an optional `--validate-upload` feature for post-upload verification.
    *   Implement the supervisor loop for handling unrecoverable errors.
*   **Phase 3: Comprehensive System & End-to-End Testing**
    *   Test every CLI flag and their interactions.
    *   Test edge case scenarios (non-existent paths, mixed file types, permissions errors).
    *   Conduct resilience testing by simulating signals (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) and network issues.
    *   Validate that log files and final reports are clear and accurate.
*   **Phase 4: Documentation Finalization**
    *   Update `README.md` with final CLI usage and features.
    *   Ensure `user_guide.md` is comprehensive.
    *   Verify the output of `main.py --help` is clear and accurate.
*   **Phase 5: Final Validation and Project Completion**
    *   Execute the complete, finalized test suite.
    *   Generate a `completion_report.md` upon 100% test passage.
    *   Signal project completion.
