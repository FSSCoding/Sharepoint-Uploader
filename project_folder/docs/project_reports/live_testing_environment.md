Live Testing Environment Setup - Project Report
Original Report Date: June 18, 2025
Project Phase: Testing

1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the steps to configure and access the live testing environment for the SharePoint Uploader application, which is used for End-to-End (E2E) testing. The environment's purpose is to validate the tool against a live SharePoint instance, allowing for realistic testing of file uploads, authentication, and error handling.

2. Key Accomplishments
*   A dedicated SharePoint test site is required.
*   An Azure AD application registration with `Sites.ReadWrite.All` API permissions is necessary.
*   A test server (or local Docker container) is needed for testing remote fetch scenarios.
*   Instructions are provided for creating and populating a `.env` file with necessary credentials by copying from [`project_folder/.env.example`](project_folder/.env.example).
*   The process for installing required Python dependencies via `pip install -r project_folder/requirements.txt` is documented.
*   Access details for the SharePoint Site URL and Test Server SSH are specified.

3. Challenges and Resolutions
*   **Challenge:** The `.env` file contains sensitive information and should not be committed to version control.
*   **Resolution:** Ensure the `.env` file is listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

4. Consolidated Status
The environment is documented and ready for configuration by developers to perform E2E tests. All prerequisites, configuration steps, and access details are outlined.

5. Next Steps (as of original date)
*   Refer to the E2E test plan in the [Testing and Validation Specification](project_folder/docs/research_and_planning/04_testing_and_validation_specification.md) for a full list of test cases.
*   Execute E2E tests, for example, a basic local upload test can be run with the command: `python project_folder/main.py --source-path /path/to/local/test/data --target-path /E2E_Test_Uploads`.
