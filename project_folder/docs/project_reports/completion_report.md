Original Report Date: June 17, 2025
Project Phase: Development

1. Executive Summary
This report analyzes the completion status of the SharePoint Folder Uploader CLI project. The project is in a stable, production-ready state, with all core features implemented and the majority of success criteria met and validated through comprehensive testing.

2. Key Accomplishments
*   All core features have been implemented and thoroughly tested, with a test suite of 50 passing tests.
*   The application successfully handles end-to-end transfers of large, multi-gigabyte folders for local uploads.
*   Upload resumability after interruptions has been implemented and validated.
*   Configuration via `.env` and `config.json` is fully functional.
*   Rich progress reporting, robust logging, and correct temporary file management have been implemented.
*   Basic usage documentation (`user_guide.md` and `README.md`) has been created and is available.

3. Challenges and Resolutions
*   A critical bug in the upload resumption logic was identified and resolved, ensuring reliable continuation of interrupted uploads.
*   A `WriteTimeout` error that occurred during large file transfers was fixed.
*   Bugs related to configuration loading and the `--keep-temp` CLI flag were resolved, ensuring correct behavior.

4. Consolidated Status
The project is considered stable and production-ready. While core functionality is robust, full completion is pending confirmation of remote SSH transfer testing and graceful signal handling.

5. Next Steps (as of original date)
*   Explicitly test and confirm the end-to-end workflow for remote directory transfers via SSH.
*   Implement and test graceful shutdown procedures for SIGINT/SIGTERM signals to ensure state is saved upon termination.
