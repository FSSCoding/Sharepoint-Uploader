SSH Module Integration - Project Report
Original Report Date: 2025-06-18
Project Phase: Development

1. Executive Summary
This report details the integration of the stable SSH module into the main application. The integration was successful, with the core logic updated to support SSH-based file transfers.

2. Key Accomplishments
- The `RemoteFetcher` class from `ssh_copy.py` was identified as the core component for SSH functionality. The `main.py` script was identified as the primary integration point.
- The `project_folder/main.py` script was modified to include command-line arguments for SSH operations (`--use-ssh`, `--ssh-host`, etc.) and to invoke the `RemoteFetcher` when the `--use-ssh` flag is present.
- The source files were already present in the correct directories, so no file copying was necessary. The integration focused on connecting the existing module to the application's entry point.

3. Challenges and Resolutions
- No file overwrites occurred. The SSH module and its tests were already part of the codebase.
- No conflicts were identified. The integration was additive, introducing new functionality without interfering with existing components.

4. Consolidated Status
The application now supports SSH file transfers via new command-line arguments. The integration was completed without any file-level conflicts. Status: Success.

5. Next Steps (as of original date)
- No next steps were outlined in the original report.
