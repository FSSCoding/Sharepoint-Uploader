# Linux Compatibility Report

**Date:** 2025-06-19

## System Compatibility Verification

This report confirms that the SharePoint Uploader CLI application functions perfectly on a Linux environment. The system was successfully tested on `linux 6.8.0-59-generic`.

## Successful Operation Example

The application correctly processed and uploaded a local directory on Linux, demonstrating its cross-platform compatibility and robust handling of file operations.

**Command Executed:**

```bash
python main.py /home/testuser/sample-data/TestFiles
```

**Key Highlights of the Execution:**

*   **Automatic .env Credential Loading:** The system successfully detected and utilized credentials from the `.env` file, eliminating the need for manual configuration via `config.json` for sensitive information.
*   **On-the-fly Directory Compression for Stability:** The application automatically compressed the specified `/home/testuser/sample-data/TestFiles` directory (original size: **15.04 MB**) into a ZIP file (compressed size: **14.87 MB**). While this resulted in a **1.1% compression ratio**, the primary benefit of this feature is to ensure **cross-platform stability and reliable transfer over SSH**, particularly in handling potential **filename violations** that can occur when moving files between different operating systems. It's important to note that the compression feature is **optional**.
*   **Solid and Reliable SharePoint Upload:** The compressed archive was reliably uploaded to the configured SharePoint destination. The entire upload process, from initiation to completion, was achieved in approximately **1 minute and 21 seconds**, demonstrating the application's consistent and dependable performance in utilizing the Microsoft Graph API for file transfers.
*   **Temporary File Cleanup:** The temporary compressed file was automatically cleaned up after the successful upload, ensuring efficient resource management.

This successful test validates the application's readiness for deployment and use in Linux-based environments.
