SharePoint Folder Uploader CLI - Project Report
Original Report Date: 2025-06-18
Project Phase: Refinement and Bug Fixing

1. Executive Summary
The project has undergone several development and refinement cycles, focusing on bug fixing, testing, and documentation. The signals indicate a progression from initial feature implementation to system-wide integration, testing, and refinement, leading to a stable state.

2. Key Accomplishments
- Implementation of the "SharePoint Folder Uploader CLI".
- Correction of environment variable loading in `project_folder/main.py`.
- Updates to `CLIENT_SECRET` in `project_folder/.env` to resolve authentication issues.
- Implementation of tests to validate error handling for invalid credentials.
- Integration of all features for system-wide validation.
- Minor bugs related to configuration loading were fixed in `project_folder/main.py`.
- A reproducing test case was created for the resumption logic bug.
- A fix was implemented in `project_folder/core/uploader.py` to preserve the upload offset across sessions.
- A comprehensive end-to-end test suite was added in `project_folder/tests/test_end_to_end.py`.
- Documentation was improved with the creation of a `user_guide.md` and updates to `README.md`.
- The cycle concluded with a `system_validation_complete` signal, stating that the application is now "resilient, validated by a comprehensive test suite, and supported by clear, accurate documentation."

3. Challenges and Resolutions
- **Challenge:** A `system_level_bug_detected` signal was raised due to a persistent `WriteTimeout` error during large file uploads (`TC-02-03`), affecting `project_folder/core/uploader.py`.
- **Resolution:** While not explicitly marked as resolved, a fix for upload resumption logic in `project_folder/core/uploader.py` might have implicitly solved this issue.
- **Challenge:** A critical bug in the "upload resumption logic" was identified, which caused uploads to restart from the beginning after session expiry.
- **Resolution:** A fix was implemented in `project_folder/core/uploader.py` to preserve the upload offset across sessions.

4. Consolidated Status
The project is currently in a stable state. The most recent development cycle successfully addressed a critical bug in the upload resumption logic and improved test coverage and documentation. However, a potential remaining issue is that the `WriteTimeout` error with large file uploads has not been explicitly marked as resolved.

5. Next Steps (as of original date)
- Verify the fix for the `WriteTimeout` error by running a targeted test to confirm that large file uploads complete successfully without timing out.
- If the test passes, the project can confidently move to the next phase of development.
- If it fails, a new debugging cycle should be initiated to address this specific problem.
