[SharePoint Folder Uploader CLI] - Project Report
Original Report Date: Not specified
Project Phase: Finalization/Refinement

1. Executive Summary
The project's objective is to create a robust, production-ready Python CLI tool named "SharePoint Folder Uploader CLI". According to the `project_blueprint.md`, this tool must handle large, resumable file uploads (up to 10GB+) from local or remote (via SSH) directories to SharePoint, with robust error handling, rich CLI feedback, and flexible configuration.

2. Key Accomplishments
- The initial framework has been scaffolded, and all core features outlined in the blueprint—including Microsoft Graph API authentication, SSH remote directory transfer, and resumable chunked uploads—have been implemented and integrated.
- The project has undergone multiple cycles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), integration, and system testing.
- The latest `system_validation_complete` signals indicate that the application is resilient, stable, and supported by a comprehensive test suite.
- Key documentation, including a `user_guide.md` and an updated `README.md`, has been created.

3. Challenges and Resolutions
- A `WriteTimeout` error during large file uploads was identified, reproduced with specific tests, and successfully fixed.
- A logic flaw in upload resumption was identified, reproduced with specific tests, and successfully fixed.

4. Consolidated Status
The project is in an advanced stage of development and appears to be largely feature-complete and stable.

5. Next Steps (as of original date)
- Conduct a final, comprehensive review and refinement cycle to ensure that every requirement and success criterion outlined in the `project_blueprint.md` is fully satisfied.
- This includes final polishing of the CLI, documentation, and handling of any remaining edge cases.
- The recommended agent to manage this finalization phase is the **`Orchestrator (Refinement & Maintenance)`**.
