# Project Organization - Report

**Original Report Date:** 2025-06-18
**Project Phase:** Refinement

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the reorganized file structure of the SharePoint Uploader CLI project. All test files, temporary files, and documentation have been properly organized while preserving the orchestration system. The project is now cleanly organized with a clear separation between core application files, documentation, and archived test/temp files.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

*   **Root Directory Structure**: The root directory is organized into `ORCHESTRATION FILES`, `PROJECT STRUCTURE`, and other top-level files.
*   **Project Folder Structure**: The `project_folder` is structured into `CORE APPLICATION`, `DOCUMENTATION`, `ARCHIVE`, and `DEVELOPMENT` directories.
*   **Moved Test Files**: All individual test scripts and runners have been moved to `archive/test_scripts/`.
*   **Moved Test Outputs**: Test data archives and results have been moved to `archive/test_outputs/`.
*   **Moved Demo Files**: Demo applications have been moved to `archive/demos/`.
*   **Moved Temporary Files**: Temporary configurations, data, and reports have been moved to `archive/temp_files/`.
*   **Moved Project Reports**: All project reports have been consolidated into `docs/project_reports/`.
*   **Preserved Core Application**: The core application files, including `main.py`, `core/`, and `tests/`, remain active and untouched.
*   **Preserved Orchestration System**: The entire orchestration system, including `.agent_config`, `.shared_state`, and the `orchestration/` directory, is 100% untouched.
