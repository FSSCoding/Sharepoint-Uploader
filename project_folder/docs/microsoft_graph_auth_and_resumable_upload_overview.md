# Microsoft Graph Authentication and Resumable File Upload Feature Specification

## User Stories

### US-1: Authenticate with Microsoft Graph
As a system administrator, I want the tool to authenticate with Microsoft Graph using app-only credentials so that I can securely access SharePoint resources.

### US-2: Handle Large File Uploads
As a developer, I want the tool to manage large file uploads using chunked, resumable sessions so that I can ensure data integrity even with unstable network conditions.

### US-3: State Persistence and Error Handling
As an IT professional, I want the tool to persist upload state and handle errors such as network dropouts and session expiry so that I can resume interrupted uploads without re-uploading entire files.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: App-Only Authentication
- The `auth.py` module must implement app-only authentication using Microsoft Graph API credentials.
- The authentication process must securely handle credentials and obtain an access token.

### AC-2: Chunked Resumable Uploads
- The `uploader.py` module must support chunked uploads for large files.
- The tool must be able to resume uploads from the last known offset in case of interruptions.

### AC-3: State Persistence and Error Handling
- The tool must persist upload state, including session URL and offset, for resumability.
- The tool must implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential back-off for chunk uploads.
- The tool must be able to re-create upload sessions and resume on session expiry.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Authentication
- The `auth.py` module must handle app-only authentication with Microsoft Graph.
- The module must securely manage credentials and obtain an access token.

### FR-2: File Uploads
- The `uploader.py` module must handle both small and large file uploads.
- For large files, the module must use chunked, resumable sessions.
- The module must persist upload state for resumability.

### FR-3: Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms
- The tool must handle network dropouts, API timeouts, and session expiries gracefully.
- The tool must implement automatic retry mechanisms with exponential back-off for chunk uploads.
- The tool must re-create upload sessions and resume on session expiry.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- The tool must handle multi-gigabyte transfers efficiently.
- The tool must recover gracefully from network dropouts, API timeouts, and session expiries.

### NFR-2: Security
- The tool must securely handle Microsoft Graph API credentials.
- The tool must use secure protocols for remote file transfer.

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- Implementing app-only authentication with Microsoft Graph.
- Handling large file uploads using chunked, resumable sessions.
- Persisting upload state and implementing error handling and retry mechanisms.

### Out of Scope
- Implementing user authentication.
- Handling file transfers over other protocols.

## Dependencies

- Microsoft Graph API for SharePoint interaction.
- Remote server via SSH for SCP/rsync operations.

## High-Level UI/UX Considerations

- The tool must provide rich CLI feedback using the "Rich" Python library.
- The tool must display progress bars for overall transfer and individual file chunks.
- The tool must show ETA and transfer rates.

## API Design Notes

- The `auth.py` module must implement the `get_access_token` function to obtain an access token.
- The `uploader.py` module must implement the `upload_file` function to handle file uploads.
- The `utils.py` module must provide helper utilities for state persistence and API retries.
