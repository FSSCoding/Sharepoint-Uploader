# Shared State - Report

**Original Report Date:** 2025-06-18
**Project Phase:** Debugging

## 1. Executive Summary

The project is currently in a debugging and refinement phase. While significant progress has been made in feature implementation, integration, and testing, a critical system-level bug related to a corrupted dependency (`bcrypt`) is preventing the SSH feature from being fully stable and blocking further progress.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

*   **Initial Scaffolding**: The project structure, boilerplate code, and initial tests were established.
*   **Feature Development and Bug Fixes**: Core features like the SharePoint Uploader CLI, Microsoft Graph API authentication, and SSH file transfer have been implemented. Several bugs have been addressed.
*   **Integration and System Testing**: Features have been integrated, and system-wide testing has been performed, validating several fixes.
*   **Documentation**: `user_guide.md` has been created, and `README.md` has been updated.

## 3. Challenges and Resolutions

*   **Current Critical Issue**: A fatal `ImportError` is being raised from the `bcrypt` library, a core dependency of the `paramiko` SSH library. The error is `ImportError: cannot import name '__author__' from 'bcrypt._bcrypt'`. This points to a corrupted dependency installation or a version incompatibility issue.
*   **Other Notable Signals**: A critical bug related to "upload resumption logic" was identified but appears to have been addressed. Multiple `system_validation_complete` signals indicate that previous bugs have been successfully resolved.

## 4. Final Status

The project is blocked by a critical dependency issue.

## 5. Next Steps

*   **Diagnose the dependency issue**: Investigate the installed versions of `bcrypt` and `paramiko` and their compatibility.
*   **Propose a fix**: This could involve reinstalling dependencies, pinning specific versions in `requirements.txt`, or finding an alternative solution.
*   **Validate the fix**: Run the SSH-related system tests to confirm that the `ImportError` is resolved.
