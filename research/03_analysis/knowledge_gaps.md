# Knowledge Gaps

This document will be populated after the initial data collection phase. It will serve as the primary driver for subsequent, targeted research cycles.

**Instructions:**
For each key research question defined in the `01_initial_queries` directory, analyze the collected data in `02_data_collection`. If the collected information is incomplete, contradictory, or insufficient to build a robust implementation, document the specific gap here.

**Example Entry:**

---

**Gap ID:** G-01
**Related Research Area:** `01_ms_graph_api_uploads.md`
**Question:** How does the API signal that an `uploadSession` has expired?
**Gap Description:**
The primary documentation describes the `404 Not Found` error for expired session URLs, but several forum posts mention receiving a `410 Gone` or even a generic `500 Internal Server Error`. It is unclear if all three need to be handled for session expiry or if the latter two are indicative of a different problem.
**Required Action:**
Formulate targeted search queries to find definitive documentation or authoritative examples of handling all three potential error codes when a chunked upload fails.
