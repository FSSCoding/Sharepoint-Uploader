## üí¨ User Testimonial: Real-World Experience

> *"I had this idea because I have a raspberry pi running a git code server I wanted to be able to easily back up to SharePoint where I have some drives available for cloud storage... I didn't really have the time to make it and I didn't really want to make it either to be honest I don't like authentication it drives me nuts and this had two forms of it that are quite different it was more just a tool that I needed to make.*
> 
> *So I thought it was a good chance to give Pheromind a workout and holy crap that's been awesome. I added one of my code files at the start so it wrote the program in a language that I understood and was compatible with my project. Through talking with Chris and playing with a few other ideas and experiments along the way I've really learned that preparing Pheromind well at the beginning and learning how to use it properly gives it the information to build within scope and feature aligned.*
> 
> *It was pretty insane and a little scary watching it code away especially when it started getting into terminal commands... But honestly guys the rest of it just happened it was freaking cool.*
> 
> *I've never had a project finish of any size with the test coverage like this all the green bars in VS Code had me somewhat wondering what was going on. I've used it a few times now and backed up a couple of folders that I've had on various computers and I can see this tool making its way into part of many of my workflows.*
> 
> *Thanks Chris for the collaboration and his fantastic contribution to AI-powered coding - this has certainly changed the way I build tools and applications now."*
